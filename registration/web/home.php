<p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, 
    which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant. The Coffea pl
    ant is native to subtropical Africa and some islands in southern Asia.[2] The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world and coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are the highly regarded arabica, and the less sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta. Once ripe, coffee beans are picked, processed, and dried. Green (unroasted) coffee beans are one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world. Once traded, the coffee beans are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and brewed to produce coffee as a beverage.
    Coffee is slightly acidic and can have a stimulating effect on humans because of its caffein
    e content. Coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the world.[3] It can be prepared and presented in a
    variety of ways (e.g., espresso, cappuccino, cafe latte, etc.). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee 
    also served. The majority of recent research suggests that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in he
    althy adults.</p>
<p>Coffee cultivation first took place in Abyssinia.[4] 
    The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears i
    n the middle of the 15th century in the Sufi shrines of Yemen.[5] In
    the Horn of Africa and Yemen, coffee was used in local religious ceremonies. 
    these ceremonies conflicted with the beliefs of the Christian church, the Ethiopia
    n Church banned the secular consumption of coffee until the reign of Emperor Menelik II.[6] 
    beverage was also banned in Ottoman Turkey during the 17th century for political reasons,[7] an
    d was associated with rebellious political activities in Europe.</p>";
